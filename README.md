So... This is my Genius Hour project in ELA class.

I will post comments in this file, so you can follow my progress.

I will also include links to images of what the program does so far.

Huh. Something cleared my first post. Anyway, this is what the program can do:
* Give a tutorial.
* Load a savegame.
* Clear a savegame.
* Display an about page.
* Display a map of your Mathtown.

This is what it can't do:
* Most anything with quests (My current objective is to resolve this.)
* Allow you to buy Decorations.
* That's it, but the Quests thing is a biggie.

## 11/10

Great news! You can now buy decorations- for a price, of course.
